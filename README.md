# Two Player Tic-Tac-Toe!

## Introduction:

Out of the three types of code listed below I am least confident in my CSS abilities so that is what I wanted the focus of this project to be. I knew that I was capable of creating many different games that would easily run in the console but being able to create something in JS and then translate/connect it to HTML and CSS was an entirely different story, so I decided to create a simple game and let the CSS be the star of the show. To be more specific I want the interactive CSS to be the star of the show. Things such has hovering mechanics and winning message pop-ups, as those things have been the hardest for me to understand on a fundamental level.


## Technological Contents:
#### HTML 
- divs and data cells along with a functional pop-up, overlay winners message
#### JavaScript  
- array creation/usage, function creation/usage, if/else statements, DOM manipulation, interpolation, arrow functions, return statements
#### CSS 
- nthchild mechanics to condense code, use of ::before and ::after to specifically place css content, use of calc and var to adjust the games visuals as needed depending on which browser the player is using

## Future Goals:

#### Near Future - 
- change the colors of the current game to make it more visually appealing
- create more of a cohesive web page also to improve visual appeal

#### Further Future -
- create a two-player 4x4 and 5x5 version of this game that can run in the same window and be selected via interactive button to give players a wider variety to play with
- create an A.I. that will play as one player to allow this 3x3 version and future versions to be playable with one person
- create an interactive color selector that will allow players to choose which color their side uses
